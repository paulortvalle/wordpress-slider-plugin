## About me

I have worked with computer since 1992 when I was a 10-year-old child. The first language that I thought was Clipper in 1997 and since of then, I am fascinated by the developer world. Although I did not work with development from 2000 to 2009, I was always studying and learning. During this time, I learned C and put my efforts into web development with PHP, CSS, and JavaScript. I introduced a systematic study at FATEC Mogi Mirim in order to improve the object-oriented programing concept and mobile development. Currently, I work for [Percepção Comunicação Empresarial](http://www.mundopercepcao.com.br/) with communication and integration projects for web, in Brazil. And also for [Elite Overseas Immigration Services](http://www.eliteimmigration.ca/) improving their client dashboard interface.
